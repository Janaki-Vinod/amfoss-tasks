Learning C was a whole new experience for me as I had prior knowledge only in python. Since I was running short of time,I couldn't learn the whole language from scratch. I just took a look at several sample codes and helped me understand how C differed from python and even the difference in basic things like ';' after every line , defining data type of each variable , size of array, importing every module and so on. It was a lot different from python. But knowing a language properly helped me a lot in understanding the code with errors and helped to develop the confidence to attempt the task. All I did was to look at basic syntax and google the errors which came in my way and I looked for the solutions. Similary for the logic errors, it was easy for me to analyse and understand the logic as programing was not new to me. It took me about 4-5 hrs to learn the c basics and debug the code. The journey was amazing!!!! my fav task.
