Eventhough I had prior I have learned HTML in my high school I had 0% knowledge about its application annd real use. I was familiar with some HTML queries and there functions , I had no idea about when, where, and how to use them. For sure, have some prior knowledge help me built confidence. About java script I had no prior idea  and it look nothing like python, the only language i knew. When I first gazed at a simple sample code it looked more like c to me. Eventhough the functions where entirely different the codes kinda looked similar, which gave me a very basic idea about the things going on in sample codes. From the tutorials given in reference link , I got some basic idea about java script. I solved some basic sample programs from the reference page which helped me a lot with my journey. I started with opening the forms and debugging the errors with the help of possible bugs comments, with which I fixed several bugs like path errors and syntax errors and adding some missing objects by using html.While working with page 2 it to be fixed with java scrpit. I added the required functions to js file which was commented in the index file of that page. For generating the graphs, I modified some codes fromthe reference page.
