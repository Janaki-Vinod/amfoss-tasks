I experienced this to be the toughest task of all.I started with android studio installation and then the flutter SDK.as I had no prior idea UI in the demo UI of flutter i searched for flutter tutorials but none had similar designs . SO my next search was for to find the type of UI given, finally recognizing it to be Onboarding UI. I saw tutorials based on that . As i didnt know dart language, I searched for the codes of the onboarding UI. assembling the codes from multiple random sources was a herculian task . Now even find it difficult to recollect proccess of assembling.
It was a very difficult task.
