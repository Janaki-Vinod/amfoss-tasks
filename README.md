**Why we must choose you?**

I started working on these tasks with almost 0 prerequisite knowledge. The only thing I knew was basic python . I have been facing issues from the tasks 0, which i tried 6 times failing every single time and successiding in the end. Almost every task that I have finished today was done from scratch learning everything by my own with the resources from internet. IT was already late when I finished installling ubunthu. All those tasks I have submitted today is done within a span of 20 days. If  I can do these many things with no prior knowledge, there is always a lot more I can do. Today at this point I realize that I have never utilized or even tried to utilize my potential . Today I realize my true potential  was not being used for this whole time . I can"t promise that I will be the best, but for sure I can promise That I can give my best shot. Even if I dont get selected for the club, I have still learned a lot. I won't regret trying this. This tasks are the best efforts of my life. I can gurantee more productive works to the club. I am open to learning new things and taking up new challenges.

**What is your plan for the next 6 months?**

I have used various languages and statred studying new things which I wasn't exposed to or even heard of. I would like to finish the things I have stated learning. I have developed an interest for them.
I also want to complete the task I have not attempted learn golang. For these tasks, I couldn't learn everything from the start ,from the basics. I just put together the few things I have learned for these specific task according to the task requirements. I would like to systematically and completely learn those things. Also looking forward into learning data science as it is trending nowadays.

** How would you contribute back to the club?**
 
 I can use my knowledge and ability to contribute my best. I hope to work with likeminded people who think out of the box. I am not pretty sure of what I will do, but will do what ever I can. I will learn more and do my maximum.

** Do you have any feedback on the selection process?**
 
 By what I understood so far, the agentha of the selection process is not to find the brightest brains or the smartest ones. It mainly focuses on testing your willingness to learn new things and your determination to do something you have'nt even heard of. It tests your will. Actually that is the most necessary thing you need when you work as a team , the willingness to learn , the willingness to do. What you know does'nt matter as long as you are willing to learn more.
